# Implementation of MACGSP6 Protocol for ESP32 

This repository contains a proof-of-concept implementation of a single channel LoRaWAN gateway. It has been tested on the ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1U, using a Semtech SX1276 transceiver (Reyax RYLR890).

The code is for testing and development purposes only, and is not meant for production usage.

Inspired by the "Routing in LoRa for smart cities: A gossip study" work of Alfonso Osorio a, Maria Calle a,âˆ—, Jose Soto a, John E. Candelo-Becerra in
